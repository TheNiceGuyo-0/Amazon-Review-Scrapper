NCMountainGirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the size and durability of this new model,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2025","My Instapot (generation 1) finally gave out on me. I was a little nervous about buying another one because of the reported ""burn errors"". But :-) I am happy to report that I am VERY happy with this new model! It's shorter and wider than my previous model.. which makes it nice because it sits very well underneath my cabinets now. Putting it together was a breeze , felt very solidly put together."

Frank,5.0 out of 5 stars,best appliance I ever bought,"Reviewed in Canada on July 12, 2020","This is an awesome product.
Easy pressure cooking with quality materials.
I bought the mini, but unless you are cooking really big things this is all you need.
I mostly cook for two, but the cooker will cook enough for four or more.
My favorite things are the fact it has a stainless steel cook pot, it has recipes and instructions, it is easy to use
it cooks beans from dry very fast and it is small. This fits under my cupboards on my kitchen counter with the
lid in the up position. I soak all my beans overnight if planned and cook them in this nice pot, unless I forgot to soak them and then it can cook in an hour or so. Don't forget that the cooking times they tell you in the information don't include the heating and cooling times which are about a half hour on either side."
Peaceful 6,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great pot...but no extra seals readily available,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2025","I did a lot of research on what Instant Pot to buy and chose this model because of the wide base. The pot is about 10"" tall and almost 12"" wide/long. Wow! The weight of this pot was shocking and heavy.

I enjoyed cooking popcorn, boiled eggs, burgers, onions, and mini peppers in it. However, I was not able to make yogurt, a main food I bought this pot for. I found out you need an extra ""clean"" seal for this dish to avoid contamination.

Other Instant Pot owners highly recommend purchasing an extra sealing ring for certain dishes because they absorb odors. So, I searched everywhere: Amazon, Instant Pot Store online, Instant Pot customer service, and Ebay. Finally, I see a sealing ring on Temu for over $28 (shipping and taxes extra)!!! There's not guarantee it will fit, and be of good quality based on customer reviews for other models of Instant Pot.

Sadly, I will return this model and ponder if I should buy a smaller, more popular Instant Pot."
Betty Turner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect bean cooker,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2025","This is one of my go-to appliances now. It’s great for beans and soups and an occasional meat dish like Rouladen.

Understand what 3qts is before you buy it, it’s not big but not tiny. I feed three with it just fine. It comes to pressure slower than a manual pressure cooker and doesn’t slow cook as well as a CrockPot. I have a zojirushi for rice so don’t use that. I use sear and pressure cooker and it works perfectly for that.

So far it’s easy to use and clean and seems built very well."
HonestMom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Instant Pot vs. Cuisinart electric pressure cooker,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2015","As nearly all things I have ordered through Amazon, the pressure cooker arrived when expected in fine condition. With this purchase I am replacing a much loved Cuisinart electric pressure cooker that is still available, and is $30 less expensive. I chose the InstantPot because the Teflon coating was wearing hard on my 2 year old Cuisinart which is bad (and not because of metal utensils). Also, I'd had to already replace the silicone ring (expected), but most recently the pressure sealing pop-up value has been problematic so the unit never pressurized. I thought about replacing the parts (i.e. the lid) but that was $55 and it seemed better to replace the whole unit at that price. So I will compare (thus far) the Cuisinart to the Instant Pot (IP) and hope it helps others since I couldn't find a similar comparison.
Many people note that the instructions for the IP aren't good. They are correct. IP seems to run home to its roots of stove top items and PSI numbers. Cuisinart never did, so I never learned this ""language."" I used my stove top Fagor only briefly. And for an electric, you don't NEED to know that stuff. You only need to know what the machine's buttons do. For my first try, I wanted to make just simple white rice. This unit is billed as a ""rice cooker,"" after all. But even the recipe in the booklet enclosed (for basmati rice) doesn't use the ""Rice"" function on the machine. I searched far and wide for what pressing the rice button meant -- how long would it cook? how much rice does the Rice setting function plan for you to be cooking, and how should you adjust timing up or down based on volume? Using Basmati rice and their ratio's of 1:1.5 grain to water, I did a manual high pressure for 8 minutes on 3 cups of rice. It was very, very good, but maybe a minute too long--the top was lovely and loose, but the bottom was clumpy and a bit further done than desirable. Now I am making a stew. Compared to the extremely hot browning function on the Cuisinart, even in a nonstick pot, the saute function in the Instant Pot's stainless pot (a major draw for me) felt a bit anemic. It browned nicely, but took much more time than a fast browning sear should, and the heat level went from ""on"" to ""hot"" (Hot being the goal) when I added cool things to the pan. (And I was browning 5-6 chunks of stew meat at a time. Not a lot. For both the rice and now the stew, the ""come to pressure"" time feels longer than the Cuisinart's. Still, I am charmed by the idea of making homemade yogurt, and that was an appeal to me on this unit. The rest I will figure out with time, because I refuse to be bested by a machine's clunky instructions when I believe we can develop a great relationship. I'll update on the Stew function. I browned the meat, sautéed some aromatics, and dumped in your usual stew vegetables, wine, beef broth and hit the STEW function, which sets at 35 minutes under pressure. I would estimate it took 10-15 minutes for the IP to reach the pressure level to begin the countdown. Again -- no telling how much meat and vegetables their 35 minutes means -- and that's just too bad that Instant Pot isn't responding to make things more clear. I will say that compared to the Cuisinart, the IP unit spews much less steam, is quieter, sits a bit shorter, has a top that is more intuitive, and the truly lovely design of dual lid holders to catch the lid liquid without having to set a hot, wet lid on the counter when you're dealing with a steaming unit. That is a very, very good thing. Amazon gets a 5 on shipping. Instant Pot has what I believe to be a great unit if I can maximize its functionality, which is not something I want to work terribly hard to accomplish. But I hear some beeping so the Stew has completed and the unit has gone into warming. Here's hoping!

Adding on from several days later. The stew was terrific, but a minute or two less on the meat would have been fine. Since then I've made an awesome soup and a lovely lemon/basil skinless, boneless chicken breast I'm sure to make again. I figured out that the sauté function could be elevated and I am content that it is, while not my stovetop, not anemic. I still think the Cuisinart is hotter, but I did love sauteeing the chicken in a bit of olive oil and butter tonight with a perfect outcome. My decision is to worry less about the function buttons, which I will learn over time, and focus on the basics I know and the recipes I love.

If you are thinking about buying an electric pressure cooker, don't waste a second more time in thought. Just GET one. You will love the investment, you will use it, you will make great meals fast, and you will explore cuts of meats and vegetables that you might not otherwise have tried, and love them. These appliances are AWESOME. I had a love affair with my Cuisinart but feel like my second relationship with Instant Pot is already terrific. I am delighted with the functionality and the more I use it, the more I love it."
Misho,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2025","wow! amazing! 3 quarts is good for a single person or 2 people but can easily serve 4 non ravenous ppl. First, I was nervous after watching videos of ppl who used to warn about the steamer being so close to the vent. Turns out these were like 5 y old videos of the older model. This version is upgraded n there is no way u will get in the way of the steam unless u want to.. So yes first time, I was nervous hid away w my cat when it was on, then was nervous to release the steam so I let it naturally depressurize then used a long wooden spoon to release the steam, and oven muffs. All this was so unnecessary.. Now? just click make sure vent is on and been placing it away from my cabinets so steam wouldn't damage it. Perfect soft centered eggs need 3 min BTW w quick release n then cold tap water to cool off.. perfection. Thought IP eggs was a hype, its not and easy to peel, for real wow! . Cleaning? stainless steel you think, it will need much scrubbing? no, so easy. I leave the lid upside down when stored cause yes the silicone gasket holds onto food smells no matter how well you clean it. I only take it off if I made some serious cooking. Not for eggs and stuff that doesn't make a mess. Anyway got an additional silicone ring just in case I decide to do deserts or yogurt in it.
I couldn't believe a straight off the freezer salmon could be well cooked in 1 min ( yes you need to count warm up time) but its like 3 min or so. Meat that would take me 4 hours to be so tender for stew is too cooked in like 15 min I just love it. still learning my way around cook times n when to release pressure. Learned with meat, quick release changes the texture so slow or natural release is best.
I ordered the 6 quart the crisp duo too.. But so far my go to is the 3 quart smaller less real estate space needed. If I need to crisp something I just use my airfryer gadget / toaster/ whatever gadget instead.
I like the 3 quart more cause it is not as large, and I can see the pot while sauteeing. The bigger one is obviously taller and wider is closer to my face. The pot turns when I try to stir things but not a big deal sometimes desirable. you have to hold the lining pot w oven mits if you want to remove it while hot or need to hold it while stirring. Overall, this 3 q size is perfect and can easily meet the needs of a couple of people even 4. No mess around the cooking area cause the lining is deep. Testing the lid on the side handles is great. Can eat good healthy food in no time. No need for crock pot option, cause why? just pressure cook it, flavor will stay there and no evaporation or that stuff. BTW the accessory included, that steam rack thingy with the 3 quart is a real joke.. eggs would slip through it broccoli n vegetables too. It's useless its just a rack at best to rest another tool on it to contain your stuff. so I got that silicone steam basket for it. No fear of pressure cookers anymore, the time , energy bills saved n convenience is worth it! It comes with aome instructions, no menus, just a barcode to use yet another app."
rick0265,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beware of this cooker when slow cooking.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2025","The most important thing to know about this cooker is that when ever you remove the lid, the steam vent switch automatically switches the vent to the closed position. Ths is an issue (for instance) when you are using the pot to slow cook. Naturally when you're slow cooking you want the steam vent open, however, when you take off the lid to stir the contents or check the water level, or for whatever reason, the steam vent will be set to the closed position. This allows pressure to build up. If you don't catch this and set the switch back to open, when you remove the lid, your meal will be on the cieling and maybe on you too."
Judy L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had the 6 quart and just bought the 8 quart to replace another brand that failed. I will be sticking with Instant Pot cookers.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2014","So far, I love this pressure cooker. So far, I have used it only once to make beef tips. I used grass fed round steak, that is a little more tricky than beef from the store. Grass fed beef has much less fat. So it has to be cooked at lower temperature, and works best with moist heat. Prior to getting this pressure cooker, I have been using the MaxiMatic EPC-808 Elite Platinum 8-Quart Pressure Cooker, and have been very happy with the results, but there have been a couple of things that could have been better. In this review, I will compare the Instant Pot and the MaxiMatic pressure cooker from my observations to-date.

- The Instant Pot has a tri-ply stainless insert and the MaxiMatic has a non-stick insert - In the time that I have had the MaxiMatic pressure cooker, the non-stick insert has become less effective. Even though foods don't stick to the insert, it gets stains that are really difficult to remove. The Instant Pot is so easy to clean with a stainless cleaner, and nothing really sticks to it. So cleanup is so much easier.
- The MaxiMatic has one setting for browning meats (brown rice) with no adjustments for simmer. So if you want to make gravy from a roast, it boils and you have to turn it off to reduce the heat. The Instant Pot has the Sauté function for browning, but the temperature can be set to low, medium, or high. So something like gravy can be simmered on the low setting.
- When cooking foods that must be entered into the cooking process at different time, such as cooking a pot roast and adding veggies later, the sealing ring in the MaxiMatic must be reseated each time you open the cooker. This can be a real pain when the top of the cooker is hot. The sealing ring in the Instant Pot stays put. It doesn't have to be reseated each time you open the cooker.

From my point of view, one downside of the Instant Pot is that you have to choose a function and then adjust the cook time from there. With the MaxiMatic, you don't need to ever use the functions if you don't want to. You can set the unit to pressure cook at whatever time you want. So there is more manual flexibility. I don't think this is a major issue because you can set the time on the Instant Pot after you select a function. You also have the option of high or low pressure that you don't have on the MaxiMatic pressure cooker.

In summary, I prefer the stainless insert of the Instant Pot over the non-stick insert of the MaxiMatic cooker. I also prefer the flexibility of the three temperature setting for the Sauté function of the Instant Pot over the high setting of the MaxiMatic pot using the brown rice setting. I was a little concerned about the lower PSI max of the Instant Pot because it is 10 PSI vs. the 12 PSI of the Maximatic, but so far this hasn't been a problem. The only consideration might be a slightly increased allowance for cook time. At least so far, this hasn't proven to be a major concern.

UPDATE 11/22/16
I had bought the 6 quart Instant Pot in July of 2014. At that time, the 8 quart Instant Pot was not available so I bought a different brand because I use the 8 quart pressure cooker the most. When the other brand would not attain pressure in the middle of making a meal, I used another 8 quart pot that I had to finish the meal. My backup pot has a non-stick pot so I don't really like it. When I saw that Amazon was offering an 8 quart Instant Pot, I bought it immediately. The night I got it, I made braised beef short ribs, and they came out so tender and flavorful. What I noticed was that no steam was lost from the Instant Pot once it attained pressure. I had made these short ribs and cooked them for the same amount of time in my old cooker. In the old one, they were still tough and not cooked enough. Using the Instant Pot they were perfect. The old cooker had a display that showed the pressure as it went up and down, and this cooker does not have that. I did like this display because, on a slow release of pressure, I could see when the pressure was down enough to open the cooker. On this cooker, you just have to let it sit for 15 minutes and then quick release the remaining pressure. I also like that this cooker has markers for open and close on the rim that help in aligning the cover to close it. This cooker also has all of the features I described previously for the 6 quart cooker. On other feature that is worth mentioning is that the cover can be held in the handles on either side of the pot after you open it. With my old pot, I had to put the cover in the sink and dripped condensation on the floor to get there. It is so much more convenient and less messy to set the cover up on one of the handles so condensation drips back into the pot. It also keeps the cover handy for times when you add veggies later and have to put the cover back on it to pressure cook added veggies.

Considering all, the Instant Pot pressure cooker is my favorite of the brands I have tried, and I would highly recommend it. Hopefully it lasts longer the the 1 1/2 years that my old cooker lasted. If not, I will update this review, but I would definitely replace it with another of the same."
Fadi Shamaan,4.0 out of 5 stars,From Pressure Cooking Novice to Culinary Master,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023","As a self-proclaimed cooking enthusiast, I recently embarked on a culinary adventure with the Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, and boy, what a game-changer it has been! This marvel of a kitchen appliance has not only simplified my cooking process but has also elevated my meals to a whole new level. Let me share my delightful experience with you.

First off, the title of ""7-in-1"" is no joke! This versatile appliance seamlessly transforms into a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, sauté pan, yogurt maker, warmer, and even a sterilizer. It's like having an entire kitchen arsenal in one compact device. I couldn't help but admire the sleek stainless steel design that added a touch of elegance to my countertop.

Getting started was a breeze, thanks to the user-friendly controls and the accompanying free app, boasting a whopping 1900 recipes. The app became my culinary companion, guiding me through various cuisines and offering endless inspiration. I was particularly thrilled by the app's meal planning feature, which made my life much easier.

Now, let's talk about the real magic—the pressure cooking feature. It dramatically reduced cooking times, allowing me to prepare mouthwatering stews, roasts, and soups in a fraction of the time. I recall the first time I attempted a beef stew, and within 30 minutes, the meat was tender, succulent, and bursting with flavors that would typically take hours to develop.

One evening, I decided to put the slow cooker mode to the test. I loaded the pot with ingredients in the morning, set the timer, and left for work. The aroma that welcomed me upon returning home was heavenly, and the slow-cooked pulled pork was an absolute hit with my family.

The sauté function came in handy for browning meats before pressure cooking, while the steamer proved ideal for preserving nutrients in vegetables. I even dabbled in homemade yogurt, and the results were surprisingly delicious. The Instant Pot Duo truly opened doors to endless culinary possibilities.

Now, let me share a funny mishap. One evening, I forgot to put the sealing ring in place, resulting in a bit of a mess. However, I quickly learned from my mistake and now double-check everything before cooking. It was a small hiccup amidst the joy this appliance has brought into my kitchen.

I must say, the Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker has also provided some hilarious moments in my kitchen. One incident stands out vividly in my mind.

I decided to try a new recipe for a creamy pasta dish. With all the ingredients prepped and ready, I excitedly added them to the Instant Pot and set the cooking time. As I eagerly awaited the delicious outcome, I couldn't help but notice an unusual amount of steam escaping from the pressure release valve.

Confused, I quickly consulted the instruction manual and realized my rookie mistake—I forgot to seal the venting knob! I rushed to rectify the situation and twisted the knob into the correct sealing position. However, when I went to release the steam, a comical mishap occurred.

In my haste, I turned the valve too quickly, resulting in a spray of creamy pasta sauce shooting up and hitting the ceiling! It was as if I had accidentally created a pasta-themed work of art on my kitchen ceiling. My initial shock was quickly replaced by uncontrollable laughter. I couldn't believe the mess I had made.

After a good laugh and a quick clean-up, I realized that even in moments of culinary chaos, the Instant Pot Duo had a way of bringing joy to the kitchen. It's not just a cooking appliance; it's a source of entertainment and shared laughter with friends and family.

Despite the occasional mishaps, the Instant Pot Duo has consistently delivered incredible results. Its ability to tenderize meats, infuse flavors, and create delicious meals in record time has truly amazed me. The convenience of having multiple cooking functions in one device has not only saved me time but also precious kitchen space.

In terms of improvements, I would appreciate a more detailed user manual. While the free app provided great recipes and guidance, a comprehensive manual would have been helpful for understanding all the features and settings. Additionally, the 3-quart capacity is perfect for smaller portions and side dishes but can be limiting for larger family gatherings.

I've discovered another delightful aspect of the Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker that I must share. It has become a game-changer when it comes to meal prep and leftovers!

As someone who values efficiency and convenience in the kitchen, the Instant Pot Duo has exceeded my expectations. With its various cooking functions, I can now prepare large batches of meals and store them for later. This has been a game-changer for my busy schedule.

One of my favorite experiences was making a big batch of chili on a Sunday afternoon. The Instant Pot allowed me to quickly cook the flavorful chili using the pressure cooker function. After enjoying a hearty dinner, I portioned out the leftovers into individual containers and stored them in the refrigerator.

Throughout the week, I simply reheated the chili in the Instant Pot using the warming function, and voila! I had delicious and piping hot meals ready in minutes. Gone are the days of reheating leftovers in the microwave, resulting in uneven heating and compromised flavors.

Additionally, the Instant Pot Duo's versatility has made meal prep a breeze. I can use the sauté function to quickly sear meats or soften vegetables before adding them to a slow-cooked recipe. The ability to switch between functions seamlessly saves me time and dirty dishes.

Moreover, the Instant Pot Duo's stainless steel cooking pot is a breeze to clean. The non-stick surface prevents food from sticking, and any remnants are easily removed with a gentle scrub. This not only saves me precious time but also ensures that my dishes come out perfectly cooked each time.

While I have had countless positive experiences with the Instant Pot Duo, there is one minor drawback worth mentioning. The steam release valve can sometimes be a bit tricky to clean thoroughly. Its design includes small crevices where residue can accumulate. However, with a little extra attention and a small brush, it's manageable.

In conclusion, the Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker has revolutionized my cooking experience. Its versatility, ease of use, and impressive cooking capabilities have made it an invaluable addition to my kitchen. From quick weeknight dinners to elaborate weekend feasts, this kitchen marvel has never disappointed. With the Instant Pot Duo by your side, you'll transform from a cooking novice to a culinary master in no time!"
B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing Pot, my favorite appliance ever.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2014","I received my Instant Pot right before the end of the year as I had pre-ordered it. I had done a good amount of research on the previous model and was convinced it could replace my small slow cooker as well as diversify my cooking and reduce my time in the kitchen. The main improvements I liked on this model over the previous model was the holder for the lid on both sides of the handles of the pot, the larger display, and the main improvement I was interested in was the dual pressure setting (mainly comes in handy for veggies for me).

At first use it took a little getting used to this new appliance. Some of the features which take some getting used to for me were the pressure release valve, and how to use the electronic controls. When cooking in a pressure cooker using traditional methods it is necessary to set the pressure release valve to closed, this allows pressure to build up in the pot during cooking. During the first few times I had forgotten to twist the pressure release valve to closed. Not doing this will eventually cause a light whistling sound and steam to come out of the release. Twist it back and all is well. I mention this because I read a review giving this pot a 1 star rating, and I could tell they hadn't closed their pressure valve based on the results they said they achieved.

Once you have used it a few times you will remember to shut the valve, as I have. Once the valve is closed then the second part I found took some getting used to was the controls, but now I realize they couldn't be easier. This is truly set it and forget style here people. Once you close the valve on the lid and lock the lid in place (you will hear an electronic ""chime"" letting you know the lid is closed) then it's as easy as hitting the button labeled ""manual"" and choosing an amount of time with the selector. This will allow you to follow recipes for times if you'd like. You can also hit the ""pressure"" button to adjust between high and low pressure. There are also a whole bunch of pre programmed recipes, a slow cooker option and a convenient ""sauté"" function which I have used a number of times. 10 seconds after choosing your options the cooker will beep 3 times and the pot will start to heat up. (make sure again you have the pressure release valve closed here)

It takes varying amounts of time for the pot to heat up but usually it's between 5 and 10 minutes for the pot to create enough pressure to where it pushes up a metal lock on the back of the unit, this prevents you from opening the pot until the pot is at a safe pressure. Once the lock sets it's only a few minutes till the timer will count down on the pot letting you know how much time is left. So keep in mind it takes 20 minutes or so from start to finish to cook 10 minutes cook time on the pressure cooker. Sometimes it seems like nothing is happening, but if you listen carefully you will hear boiling in the pot whenever it is in cycle. Once the time is up the pot will stay locked until you release the pressure by twisting the pressure release valve, or by waiting for 10 minutes to an hour for the pressure to release naturally. This will drop the metal lock in the back so you can open up the pot. One feature i love is the keep warm function. After any cooking is completed the system automatically goes to ""keep warm."" One night i forgot my chili in the pot after cooking it, but woke up late at night on the couch to realize it was kept warm all night! Pressing the off button will toggle the keep warm function on and off.

The stainless steel cooking pot is very easy to clean, however 6 of 10 on the unit for ease of clean. I love the stainless steel insert especially, it is very thick and of high quality. I just ordered a second one so i can more easily cook and store a variety of different things without having to constantly be cleaning and moving containers and food.
It does take a bit of getting used to this seemingly complex cooker, but after a little reading of the manual (which is great by the way) and some experience you will be able to cook just about anything in the instant pot. I just started cooking in the last year and I'm cooking up some amazing soups, chilies, meats, rices, pastas, and vegetables all in my first couple weeks, and i'm a beginner!
After looking into the pressure settings (it runs at around 11.x PSI on high) I am able to better plan my cook times. Note: Many recipes I found for pressure cooking on high are for 15 PSI so I have had to add a few minutes to most recipes. I also live in Denver, CO so I have to add some cook time due to the higher altitude as well. I found some good info using google on how to adjust pressure cooking for altitude.

I would highly recommend picking up a food slicer with the instant pot as well. I am dicing onions, celery, carrots, pineapple, potatoes, and more in seconds instead of minutes, then with the help of the instant pot I've got that stuff cooked quick and served hot. The slicer in combination with the instant pot cuts my cook and prep time by a third to a half I would estimate, in some cases more. I got a top rated Borner slicer off Amazon for about $30, and it's worth every penny.
Most importantly the food tastes amazing, meats are tender, rice is well cooked, veggies are incredible. I would recommend this Pressure cooker to anyone in the market for a replacement slow cooker, someone looking to cook more quickly, anyone looking to eat healthier, and for any person without access to a stove.

I plan on purchasing more as gifts for family in the future. For those of you ordering an Instant Pot: Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner!

It’s easy to use, cooks food quickly, and saves a lot of time in the kitchen. I use it for rice, sauces, beans, and even meat, and everything comes out perfectly cooked. It’s sturdy, high quality, and doesn’t take up much space. The lid seals well and it’s safe to use. A great purchase that I don’t regret ."
CHARLES E DAVENPORT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy One,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025","Have been trying to get my yogurt process going. Runny yogurt isn't what I want. We eat so much of it, the thick, strained Greek is what we are after. Has to be plain because with what we have coming out of the garden all the fruits needed are taken care of. The 7.5 quart INSTAPOT has the settings we need for a gallon batch at a time; start the process at night. Ferment all night. Drain in the strainers all day. Repeat, repeat, repeat for several days and you have a quite backlog. Learning to use the whey - the stuff is nasty to the 'uninitiated.' But it winds up as a protein supplement, literally everywhere. My weight is down, my BP is 80/114. And people ask what 'diet' I'm on. At 73, I tell them, ""Not Oprah's!"""
机器人 (robot),5.0 out of 5 stars,Where's my knife and fork? I'm ready to eat!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2014","This is my first ever pressure cooker. I had been researching different models for the past several months before deciding on this Instant Pot. There were several reasons why I chose this one.

1. It has a stainless steel inner pot. I stay away from anything with a non-stick coating on it.
2. It has the most functions such as pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, yogurt maker, etc. With limited space, it's best to have as many functions in one unit as possible.
3. Spare parts such as gaskets for the lid, pressure valves, and extra pots are readily available. For future longevity of the product, I know I can easily find replacement parts when mine wear out. It would be a shame if I had to throw the whole thing out just because I need a new gasket for the lid but can't find one anywhere.
4. It has the best reviews here on Amazon. I know you can't always tell if reviews are legit, so this may just be a psychological thing.

I never used an appliance like this before so I needed to read the instruction manual to learn how to use it. The manual is pretty easy to understand but everything is much clearer if you follow along the directions while you're actually using the machine. I made my first ever pressure cooker dinner, Chicken Parmesean, in my Instant Pot. It was very easy and very delicious. The chicken breasts were moist and tender. I can't wait to try more recipes. It does come with a small recipe book written in both English and Chinese, but I'm gonna go to the library to find a book with more recipes.

It's a very cool looking machine, kind of like a robot. I'm thinking of giving it a name. It communicates to you with all sorts of beeps, even when you're putting on or taking off the lid. Everything about the machine seems to be well built and sturdy. The inner pot is made of heavy duty stainless steel with an aluminum encapsulated base, and is polished to a very shiny finish. I think the only complaint I may have about the machine is that the lid is a bit difficult to wash because of all the creases and crevices on the underside. But overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend. I wish I bought this 10 years ago.

One word of caution!!! Do not order this from the ""seller"" Nexlus.com. Nexlus.com is a fraudulent website. They occasionally list themselves as an other seller on Amazon, offering this Instant Pot for $99 with free shipping. It seems very tempting, but I have been taking a very close look at their website and see all signs of fraud including the use of ever changing PayPal accounts and the fact that their Contact Us page is linked to a totally different website called pretendplays.com. Once again, I would strongly recommend staying away from Nexlus.com. Play it safe. Do what I did and order it directly from Amazon.

Update 8/26/2014: Good news! The fraudulent site nexlus.com has been shut down.

Update 9/21/2014: After having this Instant Pot for over a month, I have to say I've been using it more than I ever expected. And I don't need to use my big regular oven as much anymore. I've mostly been using it as a pressure cooker, but also as a rice cooker and slow cooker. It has made cooking real food much more convenient especially during busy nights when I don't really have time to plan what to cook. On one such night, I threw in some whole potatoes, some pork chops seasoned with salt & pepper, and 3/4 cups water, Cooked it on high pressure for 10 mins, then released the pressure and threw in some corn on the cob. Cooked it on high pressure for another 4 mins. Everything came out great. The corn was cooked to perfection, the pork chops were tender and juicy, and the potatoes were nice and moist, unlike when I nuke them in the microwave. It was so simple and all done in one pot. Really great!

Update 11/13/2014: This Instant Pot is truly an energy efficient cooker. Over the past several months of using it on a regular basis, I have seen a very definite decrease in both my gas and electricity bills. How often, if ever, do you see your bills go down? Love it.

Update 2/1/2015: After using this Instant Pot for 6 months now, I am still just as excited about using it as I was the day I first got it. I frequently cook whole chickens in it, ranging from 4 to 7 lbs without any problems. I've also used it to make Chinese Tea Eggs. I actually think the eggs came out better than when I make them on the stovetop and in less time too.

So Instant Pot recently released the Bluetooth enabled IP-Smart. When I was first thinking of buying a pressure cooker months ago, I had heard that it was in the works and would be released sometime in December. I was intrigued by it, but decided not to wait and so I bought the IP-Duo60. Now that the IP-Smart has been released, I think I made the right choice. The IP-Smart is double the price of the IP-Duo60. I don't think the extra benefits are worth the extra cost. After all, you still have to be in the kitchen to load the food into the cooker. And with Bluetooth being short range, you can't venture too far away without losing the signal. I think the IP-Duo60 is perfect as it is. I just load in the food, set the cooking time then walk away and do other things. I never feel the need to check on it. It's simple and easy.

Update 7/12/2016: I've had my Instant Pot for nearly 2 years now. It's still working great. I've had zero issues with it. I haven't even replaced the lid gasket yet. When I first got the Pot, I would use it about once a week. Over time, as I gained more expertise in cooking with it, I now use it just about every day. I'm even at the point where I sometimes need two pressure cookers. I'm seriously considering buying another one."
Corali-Namar López,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Pressure/instant pod,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2025",Excellent purchase. Very user friendly and faster compared to other brands. Cook time is lees than others. Functionality is top since you have multiple options. Your cooking has the most intense flavor for your recipes. Heat up time is less than others.
Mona Lisa (M.W.),5.0 out of 5 stars,My new kitchen friend! (Update),"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2014","Some of the positive reviews here have expressed many wonderful aspects about the Instant pot which I don't feel the need to repeat. I agree with all of them!
I've been a stove top pressure cooker person for over 20 years and wasn't really very knowledgable about electric pressure cookers. Lately I've been searching online for pressure cooker recipes and I started noticing how many people love their electric pressure cookers. I was drawn to the convenience of ""set it and forget it"" as well as the many other functions electric pressure cookers offer.

Addressing Cook's Illustrated advice on pressure cookers:
In spite of what Cook's Illustrated said about electric pressure cookers, to me electric pots like this that perform several functions should not quite be placed in the same category as stove top pressure cookers. In my opinion they should not be tested together unless one is a designated Electric Pressure Cooker with no other features on it. It's almost trying to compare apples to oranges, so to speak. (BTW I am a Cook's Illustrated addict!- I learned to cook from them...)

Although I have not had the Instant Pot long I can tell it will be a very useful time saving addition to my kitchen right along side my regular pressure cooker. I have two stove top pressure cookers, and have tried to use both to cook two different things at the same time but found it too cumbersome and attention draining to use both at once. Not a problem with the Instant pot! It's easy to fire both of them up simutaneously because Instant Pot takes over and requires very little monitoring. Example: We love greens and now I can plop them in the Instant Pot while I have something going in the Kuhn Rikon. Perfect! Talk about a fast dinner! Easy cleanup too.
Note: Pressure cooking retains up to 90% of nutritional value of food over stove top methods,...as well as easier cleanup. That includes no wiping off the top of your cooktop/range.

I chose the Instant Pot because after researching all of the other brands it appeared to be the cooker with the least complaints, as well as the fact that it came with a stainless steel bowl. Healthier and nothing to peel off!
I was ready to order last year's model but saw that this new model was about to be released and that it also made yogurt which is a huge plus for us, so I waited.

I'm really impressed with the quality of this cooker! It feels and looks like it was very well thought out and constructed.
It's channel on youtube is very thorough, covering every detail about InstantPot including instruction for usage as well as troubleshooting and care.

After receiving, having watched most of the videos on youtube, I carefully went through the manual and went through the trial run which the manual suggested to try first. From there on it was smooth sailing and easy to figure out. Both dishes I tested which were brown rice and Ossobuco turned out delicious. I will make a change in the Ossobuco next time. I used ""Stew Normal"" and next time I will go ""Stew Less"" because the meat was a bit overcooked for my liking. The flavor of the broth was awesome though but I cooked the meat a tad too long so that it released too much flavor into the broth. The brown rice was perfect.
I have to say that I was impressed at how quickly the pot came to pressure, especially with hot liquid.
I did not heat the liquid for the rice but the braising liquid for the lamb I let heat up on ""saute high"" before I added the lamb and put the lid on. It came up to pressure quickly.
NOTE/TIP: I pre-heated lamb braise liquid mix to simmer because there were diced tomatoes in the braising liquid and I wanted to give a quick stir before placing lid on so they wouldn't sit in one place for long against the super heated bottom and possibly burn before coming to pressure. It is a good trick for me if I have questions with mixes of tomato sauce or sweet items in pot. Simmer/boil it first and stir right before putting lid on to bring it to pressure.

So far I am loving the InstantPot. It's extremely user friendly and appears to be very good quality. It performs as described. I look forward to trying new recipes plus using it along side my stove top cooker.

I'm finding that everything that comes out of a pressure cooker simply tastes better, even simple potatoes and carrots! It's a learning curb with the timings, but once you ""get it"" I think most anyone would agree that food tastes better when cooked in a pressure cooker.

Time will see how well the Instant Pot holds up!

PS: A bag of Trader Joe's Kale, (triple washed)
steamer fan, two cups of water, 5 minutes on LOW pressure, quick release= perfection! No salt needed nor butter or anything else! The natural salt comes out in the Kale! Swoon worthy! I heated the water first on Saute' High to a boil before adding the kale and put the top on.

Update November 4 2015:
I now have 2 Instant Pots, one which is the Smart Pot Blue Tooth model. I use both of them all the time. I've also purchased 3 Duo's for gifts. Everyone loves their Instant Pot!"
Dawn R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this pressure cooker.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2025","Love this pot. So far I have only pressure cooked. It cleans up easily. The lid can go into the dishwasher, but I hand wash it. It was hard to remove the seal ring the first time, but after that fairly easy because I knew what to do. Can't wait until artichokes are in season. It will be nice to cook them over a shorter time. My first meal was a Cornish game hen. The meat was moist and tender and falling off the bone. Very yummy. I bought the smallest size, perfect for a single person but can also feed a family."
Daimi CM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, just too small for me","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2025","The Instant Pot is excellent quality, very easy to use, and has super practical features. I loved the stainless steel design and how quickly it cooks. However, I’m returning it because it’s too small for my family’s needs. If you’re looking for a pot for medium portions, it’s perfect."
Lyssa D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Beginners + Game Changer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2025","This Instant Pot RIO Wide Base has quickly become the MVP of my kitchen. I have used other models before, but this one stands out for its wider base which makes sautéing and browning so much easier. Food cooks more evenly and there is more surface area to work with, which is great when I am prepping meals for family or doing batch cooking.

A few helpful tips for anyone new to the Instant Pot:

Always make sure the silicone sealing ring is properly in place before starting. If the lid does not seal, the pot will not build pressure.

Use the sauté function to brown meat or onions before pressure cooking-it saves time and adds a lot of flavor.

After pressure cooking, give it 10 to 15 minutes to naturally release before doing a quick release. This helps prevent splatter and keeps meat tender.

Keep an extra sealing ring on hand. The ring tends to absorb odors over time, especially after cooking dishes like curry or chili.

Clean the lid and anti-block shield after each use. These small parts are easy to miss but important for safe operation.

The controls are intuitive and easy to use. I was able to make perfectly cooked rice, shredded chicken, and even cheesecake without much effort. It is truly a set-it-and-forget-it kind of appliance that takes the stress out of cooking. The included instructions are clear, but I also recommend watching a quick YouTube tutorial if you are brand new to pressure cooking."

Aundrea,5.0 out of 5 stars,This has changed the way we eat. It's easier to use than I thought it would be.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2016","There are so many people who say the can't cook, but I swear I'm on a whole new level of not being able to cook. This little appliance helps expand our menu and I Have learned to do so much with it. I will sum up in a nutshell, I love how easy it is and how I throw everything in it comes out done. No stirring and not many messy dishes. I still don't love it for meats (which I don't eat much of anyway), but I think that's just a matter of needing to experiment more with them. I seriously can't believe how many foods can be cooked in here!

What got me thinking about the IP was talking to a friend at work who is a firefighter. He works long shifts with mostly men, they can't really cook, but they just buy meat and throw it in here. He swore by it. Then someone else chimed in and said they pressure cook a lot. About a month later it went on sale for Prime Day and I picked it up. I am all of a sudden a much, much better cook! There are so many cookbooks for this, my favorite being Hip Pressure Cooking: Fast, Fresh, and Flavorful and there's a wonderful Facebook page where people post their successes and fails, so we can all learn from each other. This whole last month has been wonderful. I'll highlight some things I've tried or heard about:

-Chicken: For the first time every I cooked a whole chicken (see picture of it falling apart). My husband couldn't believe I cooked a whole chicken since I usually buy them at the store already made. It was excellent. I did 6 minutes per pound + 2 minutes. I also cook chicken thighs for dinner about once a week, which I had never cooked before. I do that for 10 minutes with some chicken broth and whichever seasoning sounds good. Ironically enough, I can't get my classic boneless, skinless chicken breasts to turn out, but based on my Facebook group a lot of people have success with them.
-Pot roast: I tried this once and it didn't work great. It was a very lean, thick cut of meat. I heard that the leaner meats are harder to do. Next time I'll try something different.
-Eggs: I can hard boil 30 eggs at once!!! I work 12 hour shifts and eat 4 with my lunch and 4 with my dinner. Since I work 4 days in a row I have to hard boil 32 eggs. I used to use my egg cooker and do 7 at a time, which was a pain. Now it's quick and easy!
-Steel cut oats: Another thing that I never ate before. At one point a couple years ago we tried making them a few times, but it's so annoying having to stir the pot all the time and then half the time I ended up with some crusted on the bottom which was annoying to clean up. Now I use the PIP (pot in the pot) method. I put 1 cup of water in the bottom, then the trivet in, then 1 cup of steel cut oats in a large Pyrex glass dish with 2 1/2 cups of water. I put it on for 10 minutes manual high pressure and walk away. Once the pressure releases and I open it they are perfect! I then divide them up into mason jars and put them in the fridge. At breakfast time I warm them up, add some milk for creaminess and they are perfect. We eat them every single morning now. The only dish I have is the Pyrex bowl and I just rinse the metal pot out since it didn't touch any food.
-Soups: I had never made soup before this. I have made chicken noodle soup many times and everyone loves it. I HATE how chicken noodle soup always has mushy noodles. Not mine! I cook the noodles to how I like them. I've bene wanting to experiment with more soups, but I'll do that in winter.
-Yogurt: Another amazing feature. I've made yogurt 3 times and love it. My 2 year old only eats my yogurt. I can make a gallon of organic yogurt for a fraction of the cost of buying it at the store. It takes some patience, but the hands on work part of it is only about 20 minutes. There's a lot of waiting for things to heat, cool, incubate, set. I've finally learned when to start to have each step finish at the right time. Feel free to ask if you have questions.
-Sides: I found a recipe for a mac and cheese that everyone loves. My daughter and her friends are always begging me for it. The best part? It's only 5 ingredients (pasta, heavy whip, butter, salt and cheese). It also only requires washing a cheese grater and the pot and it only takes 20 minute from start to finish. No hard to pronounce, artificial, food dyed ingredients. I have also mastered spaghetti with meat sauce. Before this I had never once made spaghetti with meat sauce. Now I do it all the time. Again, I only have ONE thing to clean afterwards. If I tried doing with without the IP I would have a pan for the meat, pot for the pasta, strainer. It only takes about 20 minutes start to finish. It can be real simple (meat, jar of sauce, pasta, water) or get really complicated with making your own sauce (even then it's still pretty easy).
-Veggies: Many veggies can be cooked in here. Delicate ones, like broccoli are harder to do. Con on the cob in here is amazing though. Much quicker than any other method.
-Deserts: I haven't made a desert yet, but on my Facebook group a ton of people are making cheesecake. I try to keep deserts out of the house and just have them for special treats when we're out. So I haven't tried this. A ton of people in my Facebook group are doing it and they look like they turn out great.
-Chicken broth: I am not the type of woman who makes chicken broth. My step-mom does that kind of stuff and I look at her like ""why don't you just buy it"". Well, now I am the type of person who makes chicken broth. After throwing a whole chicken in here I take the carcass (I hate that word!) and put it back in with some veggies, set it for 2 hours and it's done! I strain it and then have beautiful, healthy, yummy chicken broth. The first time I did it my husband looked at me like I was cray-cray. Now he helps by saving his bones. There is no better chicken noodle soup that when it's made with homemade broth! Yummy!!!
-Spaghetti squash: This is one food I accepted that it's harder to make than it's worth, so we hadn't eaten it in years. Not anymore! I put it in for 20 minutes without cutting it. When I opened the pot the squash is intact, but with the skin peeling off. It's easy to cut it in half from there, scoop out the seeds and separate it.
-Applesauce: Whenever my apples start getting too soft, I peel them, use my little apple slicer and throw them in here with some cinnamon. There are recipes for if you want to add sugar, lemon, honey, ect. I prefer just apples and cinnamon though since it's healthy and natural. My kids love it. 8 minutes on manual with a natural release. I just stir it with a fork and don't even need to blend it. There are small, very soft chunks. I wish I had this when my son was a baby!

Those are a few of them things I've made. I have learned to experiment more. Since I usually don't have to do many dishes with the IP I tend to enjoy experimenting. I have a cookbook I write all of my successes in. My family is constant surprised at how much this has changed how we eat. I usually don't keep appliances out on my counter, but since I use this at least once a day I never put it away. The only downfall is I think there is a learning curve to it. It's a little intimidating at first and requires some trial and error. I was terrified of almost everything the first time I did it. 90% of everything has come out great. I'm learning what I like to cook and don't like to cook in it. I love that when we have a last minute neighborhood get together (it happens a few times a week) I can whip up a pasta dish and veggie real quick.

Tips (Added Jan 2017):
-Recipes generally don't include time to come to pressure. Think of this is the same as your oven warming up or water boiling. After your food goes in the pot it has the pressurize, then the timer starts counting down. You can speed this up but turning on ""saute"" first. It cuts the time more than in half.
-Instructions have lingo related to you the pressure gets released. First there's natural pressure release (NPR). This is just leaving the pot alone until the pin drops, indicating there's no pressure in the pot. The lid can then be removed safely. Then there's a quick release (QR), which is where you turn the pressure release valve at the far side of the pressure cooker. This takes about a minute and releases a bunch of steam, so you probably don't want this under a cabinet. There is also a chance of some food/fluid coming out, depending on what's in the pot and how full it is. If that happens you can wait for it to do the NPR or you can do short, slow bursts.
-If you're having problems with getting anything to work check all the parts first. Is the silicone ring in place? Is the pin in place and able to move up and down? Is the valve set to ""sealing""? Is there enough water/fluid in the pot to pressurize?

Nov 2016 update: Well, it's not longer sitting on my counter, but I still use it about 2-3 times a week, which is more than any other appliance. I got over the honeymoon period, where I tried EVERY food in here. Now I know what I like and what I don't like in here and I stick with that. I recommend you get 2-3 good cookbooks with this and start finding fun recipes on Pinterest. I keep adding pictures and things in my review."
Sandy Nannen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review from a confirmed foodaholic,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2014","Over the years, I have purchased hundreds of items from Amazon, and for the most part, got what I expected. I never reviewed any of them. But from the moment I received my Instant Pot, I felt that I had purchased something that not only exceeded my expectations, but will make my life easier (and more delicious)!

I am a holistic nutritionist and a follower of a lower carb/paleo/primal lifestyle (and yes, it is not only a food regimen, but a lifestyle). Many of the meals I prepare require advance planning and preparation, and I am OK with that, realizing that it is an investment in my family's health and wellbeing. I was looking for something that would support my food choices and perhaps make it a little less time-consuming. I have used a crockpot extensively over the past years and while I appreciate the ease of use and the ability to put a meal on the table soon after I got home in the evening, there is that ""everything tastes the same"" factor I was running into with my family.

So I began thinking about ways to cook my meals faster and realized that a pressure cooker may be the answer. But, I am scared of pressure cookers. Even though my head tells me that people have been using them for many years with no problems, my heart said there was a strong chance I could blow up the entire kitchen, myself included. I had no idea there were electric, programmable pressure cookers out there that would virtually eliminate that worry until I began researching them, first on Amazon, and then on other websites. I eventually purchased the Instant Pot over the others because of the stainless steel insert (no aluminum), the size of the pot (I wanted a larger capacity), and the ease of use.

The day it arrived, I plugged it in and began reading the manual. The manual was very helpful, even included a suggested trial run to familiarize one with the basics. My first meal was potato soup (I know potatoes are not low carb or paleo, but once in a while you gotta have potato soup). I was amazed at how easy and delicious it was to make this soup that would normally take a couple of hours. I just coarsely chopped the vegetables, threw those in the pot, added the seasonings and the liquid, started the pressure cooker option, and in 20 minutes all I had to do was use my immersion blender to puree the soup, add some cheese, stir and it was ready to eat. AND the soup was every bit as good as my slower version that keeps me tied to the kitchen to stir and monitor until it's done. That is the hidden beauty of this appliance, that while it's cooking your food, you are free to do other things such as harass your kids to get their homework done. No more watching over a pot!

My second recipe was lemon pepper chicken wings. There is a searing option, so first I browned the wings in a bit of butter, then added lemon pepper, salt, and 2 more tablespoons of butter. Put on the lid, set the pressure cooker for 25 minutes, and out came the most delicious, fall-of-the-bone wings just loaded with flavor. The family went wild!

I also made mushroom gravy (no flour) pork chops in 30 minutes in the pressure cooker - the gravy was so good my son ate in on top of some gluten free noodles the next day for lunch - and a breakfast meat loaf in the slow cooker, also a winner.

I am also using this to reheat food since we don't use the microwave anymore and I'm finding that it seems easier and makes less of a mess than going stovetop.

That's a pretty long review for a first-timer but I am so enthusiastic about this product that I just had to share."
DLO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2018","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P.

To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan.

Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan.

Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup.

Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying?

Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer... :)

********
ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets...

3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too.

Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion.

Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from.

Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle.

In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier."

Dee L. Ramon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for cheesecake.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2025","So I have 4 other Instapots of various sizes and ages. I got this one because I liked the idea of the wider base. Below is based on taking out of box and doing a pressure test.

Plus - steam release button is farther away - bit safety plus
Downside - no place to put the lid of the base and the lid is large and HEAVY. To me this is a big disadvantage.
The popup button for when pressure is achieved is very hard to see, it is recessed. Now this may be for safety, but it makes it hard to see from a distance or if you are short. Yes I know it can be seen on panel, but many times I may not be directly in front, as it is typically on the island.
The wider base takes up much more cabinet space.

The wider base gives much more room for cheesecake pans. This makes the removal much easier.

The wider base allows sauting more at a time."
noguaynabita,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a convenient little pot!!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2025","Got a 3 qt pot. I first used to cook dry beans, which are so hard to soften.

And I tested out the slow cooker with Chow's Slow Cooker Chicken Tacos. It took a mere 2 hours (adjusted to MORE, or high). I use 2 jalapeños in place of the harder-to-find habanero pepper and add 1 tablespoon chili powder. Also perfection. I'm still using my original gasket rings, one for savory foods, one for sweets and both are holding up fine. I've moved my slow cooker and rice cooker to the garage, because I just don't use them anymore. And like most long-time users, I never use the preset programs, because most recipes require a timing adjustment anyway. It's just easier to use the manual button for everything. If you're a fan of split pea soup, you've got to try Kenji's technique from Serious Eats. Saute ham and aromatics until softened, about 3-5 minutes, then add peas and liquid. Cook under pressure for 20 minutes and quick release the pressure. Stir and the peas melt into perfect smoothness. I know, it goes against the warnings, but it works. I've never had any issue with the pressure valve getting clogged or peas spewing out the valve. I used to make this with slow release, but Kenji's method is far superior and takes only 30 minutes, start to finish. Try it! I've also replaced my old favorite steamer basket for one with a handle, the Hartigo steamer basket. It's pricey, but copycats as low as $9.99 are now available. Most of them are probably just as good, search for Hartigo and read the reviews to make sure you're not getting a piece of junk.

FIRST UPDATE - 11 months later, I'm still loving my Instant Pot. This winter I've added my favorite soups to it's repertoire. Senate Bean soup (recipe from Saveur.com) is the best bean soup ever, with only 12 minutes under pressure. For the two of us, I skip the ham hocks and buy a chunk of ham from the deli counter at the supermarket that I cut into half-inch pieces. I replace half the cooking water with low-sodium chicken broth for deeper flavor. Split pea soup is also the easiest ever, cooking in just 10 minutes. I use chicken broth and diced ham in it, too, unless it's January, when I toss in the bone from our Christmas ham. When I don't have any ham at all, I bring out my secret weapons, ham soup base and liquid smoke. All the same flavors, less money! For the holidays I made a pumpkin cheesecake that was sheer heaven. I even made that Bolognese sauce I was planning in my original review and my dude and DIL declared it the best they'd ever tasted. She's bonkers for my refried beans, too.

I routinely use it to make mashed potatoes for two or a crowd. I made them for 11 people at Thanksgiving and for just the two of us last week. I use my steamer basket to hold them. I bought this RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket and had my guy remove the handles. Perfect fit! Best thing? Because they sit above the liquid, they absorb less water, which means they taste a lot more like potatoes. Doesn't matter whether I'm cooking 1 potato or 9, it takes 8 minutes and a quick release. On turkey day we riced them right into the liner pot, added half and half, butter and set it to keep warm while we finished up with gravy and getting things out to the table. Baby yukon or red potatoes, cooked whole with skins on, are cooked the same way and are so much better than boiled. Tossed with butter, salt and pepper, they're one of the easiest sides ever. For them I use this Stainless Steel Steaming Steamer Rack 8.5 Inch Diameter , which is great for things that won't fit in the basket. Best of all, I store both of them right in the Instant Pot along with rack that came with it. A good thing, too, because I've about run out of storage space in my kitchen. Fortunately, I use my IP often enough that it pays to keep it on the counter. My stand mixer, used maybe once a month, has been relegated to a cabinet.

The next thing I want to conquer is Chile Verde for two. I plan to use boneless country-style pork ribs as a smaller cut alternative to pork butt. I'm still trying to find the perfect recipe that I can adapt to the IP. I continue to be amazed at the things I can cook in one pot, making cleanup a breeze. The convenience, time savings and above all, the taste, keeps me on the lookout for new things to make in it. In fact, every time I read a recipe for a braise of any kind, I mentally begin to rewrite it to work in my IP. Full disclosure, I still haven't used the slow cooker function, because cooking under pressure produces better food than my slow cookers ever have.

ORIGINAL REVIEW - I've had my IP for 3 months. In that time I've used it to make ribs, steel cut oats, my very first ever baked cheesecake (no cracking!), pulled pork (BBQ and Mexican), chile Colorado (wondrous), risotto (yes I did) and beef tips in gravy (so good). That's not all I've made in it, but it's a small sampling.

Other reviewers have gone into great detail about it's features and functions. I'm more into telling you how it fits into my lifestyle. I'm an early retiree, living in Tampa, FL with my husband. Our son, DIL and their 4 young wolves live on the next block and we're often together on the weekends and even some weeknights. I'm a fairly accomplished home cook and cook most things from scratch because they taste better and take only a little longer. I'm all about making the process easier, faster and better. I also HATE standing over a hot stove for a long time. My Instant Pot works well, whether cooking for 2 as I usually do, or feeding the entire wolf pack (that's 8 of us when we're all together).

I don't like to use my oven unless absolutely necessary. By far my most used appliance is my Breville Smart Oven (the big one). It keeps my kitchen much cooler year 'round. I consider slow cookers too hot to use indoors in summer, as running on low all day my kitchen still gets warm, even with a ceiling fan. My Instant Pot is a slow cooker, too, and it doesn't heat up my kitchen at all. It's just better insulated, but I've found that meals are so good under pressure that there's no need to use the slow cooker function. I keep meaning to, but speed always seems to prevail. I love that I can make roasts and other long-cooking things that we used to reserve for cooler months.

One of my concerns was the ability to cook smaller cuts of meat and smaller volumes of other foods than the recipes indicate. I was assured by my friends at Chowhound.com that this was simple. For meats, I just buy a smaller cut from the same area of the cow or pig. Instead of a pork butt, I use blade steak or boneless country ribs. For chuck roast, I use chuck steak or boneless beef ribs. These things all cook in about 35 minutes.

This being my first pressure cooker, I had no idea how to use one, and specifically, I'm pretty clueless about cooking times because they're all over the charts, with many cookbooks (I'm looking at you, Great Big Pressure Cooker Cookbook with your 10 minute risotto) being no help at all. Or others which suggest we Increase the stovetop time by 30% for every recipe? Who thought that was the right way to go? My best results have come from the recipes on Serious Eats and Barbara Schieving's website, Pressurecookingtoday.com, using the timing charts on the IP website or hippressurecooking.com. Note that Barbara often lists much longer times for roasts than needed.

All the things I've made in it? Chile Colorado. I served it cubed the first night, then shredded the leftovers for burritos. Meyer Lemon Cheesecake, Creamy Parmesan Risotto, Lime Cilantro Rice, Pulled Pork, Baked Beans, Weeknight Pot Roast & Potatoes, White Rice (much faster than my rice cooker), Steel Cut Oats, Beef Tips, Pork Carnitas, Refried beans. I like to keep those on hand. I soak pintos overnight in the IP's pot, cook them with a quartered onion and mash them with butter or bacon grease, cumin and chili powder, right in the pot after reserving the liquid. They cost half as much as buying canned beans and taste worlds better. Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender in 30 minutes. It was easy to make a double batch for the wolfpack, chill them overnight and finish on the grill next day. Next week I'm making the classic Bolognese from the ATK book which is only one ingredient away from Marcella Hazan's famous all-day version of the sauce. Total time, 90 minutes instead of 4 hours.

Best things about the Instant Pot, aside from how it makes food taste? It's effortless. Really, push Start and walk away. And the steel inner pot is wonderful. Most things I've made begin with the Sauté setting before going under pressure. We get superior browning before deglazing the pan with liquid. Although the silicone gasket now reeks of chili it hasn't affected anything else. If anyone knows how to remove the smell from it, let me know. Silicone is stubborn that way. I have a 2nd gasket that I use for oatmeal, rice and cheesecake. The gasket is easy to remove and replace. The steel pot goes into the dishwasher. I'm considering getting a nonstick pot for rice and oats. This handy appliance has transformed my summertime cooking, allowing me to break away from our usual salads and grilled chicken rut. Can't wait to see what it does for stews and chilis in winter."
ShopperFromIL,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect size for a 2-3 people,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2025","Perfect size for 2 or 3 people and so easy to setup and put away.

The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the different food (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).

It significantly reduces cooking times, making it a lifesaver on busy weeknights. Whether I'm preparing tender stews, fall-off-the-bone ribs, or flavor-packed soups, the Instant Pot never fails to deliver perfectly cooked meals in a fraction of the time.

The included app with hundreds of recipes is also a huge bonus — it makes meal planning so much easier. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced cook, this Instant Pot takes the stress out of dinner prep. Highly recommend!"
Walter O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,InstantPot IP-Duo60 versatility is hard to beat,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2014","This is a 6 month update - Have used the product now for about 6 months and feel it proper to update some of my former comments as I have become more familiar with it's features. (I don't shill for Amazon or InstantPot, this is an independent appraisal)

A lot of 5 star ratings. My initial rating was four stars. After a fair amount of use I decided to upgrade it to five. I really like InstantPot and would recommend it to others. I do a lot of soups and stews, a meal in a bowl; I dislike washing dishes! After many years of cooking for a crowd 3 times a day, my wife does not want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. She is a good cook when in the mood, but is the undisputed speed-queen in fixing a meal. She opens 5 cans, dumps them into a large saucepan, a little water and seasoning; 5 minutes later on High heat - Voila! - almost scorched Dinner. For gals who have cooked over 10,000 meals, this may be just the ticket! I enjoy cooking! My preferred menu utilizes pressure cooking to large extent because I live at 5,000 ft. elevation. A must if you live in Leadville Colo.

My instant pot occupies a small unused ledge in the corner of the kitchen. Two instant pots together would nicely fill the space. Main reason I bought the InstantPot Duo 60 is the removable Tri-clad bottom mirror-finish all stainless steel liner (looks like chrome), along with the delay and cooking timer auto-shutoff. This sets it apart from old-time swisher type 1st Gen P.C.'s. An added lower pressure setting extends its ability to more tender foods. Tender vegetables and yogurt making features are what differs it from the non-duo 60. I haven't made Yogurt yet, but as a Diabetic, crisp veggies are a priority. Sometime soon I'm gonna try making some Yogurt. I've used it in several different modes, enough to feel comfortable about offering my little opinion. To make a stew, you can brown the meat, pressure cook it until tender, quickly de-pressurize, add some beans or veggies, put on the glass lid, set the timer for 2 or 3 hours and slow cook until done. Eat the meal, put the entire steel pot of leftovers with glass lid, (must be ordered separately), in the fridge for tomorrow or day after, all using a single container using only one very safe, quiet, clean appliance. For Chicken Soup with Matzo Balls I cook a whole chicken on the Poultry setting for 35 minutes and let it depressurize on its own. Still under pressure it actually cooks for another 15 minutes. Remove the Chicken, de-skin and de-bone all those little bones and cartilage. Set the pot outside on top of the Barbecue for a few hours, (when it's cold out), to solidify and remove all but some of the surface layer of fat. Put the shredded chicken pieces back in, add the veggies and seasonings, another 6 minutes low pressure cooking or slow cook 'till done; add the freshly cooked, hot Matzo Balls when serving. Others have said they have purchased an extra liner and glass lid so you can see how that would extend its usability. The liner really is easy to clean. Rinse it out under the hot water, a soapy sponge, re-rinse and set it in the sink basket to dry. It's operation is really quiet and there is not any visible steam whooshing through the air. You could very easily cook on the dining room table, or a small adjacent table. Making a pot of beans outdoors next to the barbecue is easy too.

Lack of a 15 lb setting poses a problem for some potential buyers as it does add somewhat to the overall cooking time. Some P.C. reviewers have remarked that is a big problem for them. The actual high pressure setting is 11 psi which drops the cooking temp for 260 to 240 degrees. The low pressure is 7 psi. I'm sure it must add to cooking time, but for me, it is not a consideration. In some instances I find it preferable to use my second electric 15 psi P.C. tucked away in another kitchen corner using my stove to steam some Broccoli, using my Barbeque as a convection oven for a Casserole in the summer so I don't heat up the house, If I have two electric pressure cookers going at once it's getting a big Sunday meal done in even less time! During the week I just nuke leftovers.

Initially, at the start you can program it just about any way you like over a wide range of different settings and presets. After 10 seconds has elapsed, it starts whatever you have programmed and cannot be changed without stopping and resetting it. In my initial review I complained a little about the Manual setting. I have come to realize that a good percentage of negative comments (aside from shipping damage or DOA out of the box) are because the person does not understand the operation of the device. Well... I guess I am no different than anyone else in that I misunderstood the purpose of the Manual Program. Manual is a pressure cook only setting and it allows you to vary the P.C. time. No need to change temp, just time and pressure. If you can't find any of the preset times to suit you. Manual will allow you to choose either pressure, or any time from 1 - 120 minutes. Most will not really need to use Manual, but they added it just in case someone finds it useful I guess. Except for the Rice setting you can use almost any setting any way you want, OR you can do it by the book. You can pretty much do whatever you want. You could cook a Chicken using the Bean/Stew setting. Pssst! there aren't any InstantPot police! Because it has so many settings, it takes a while to find all the various available combinations. I've found combinations that cover all the bases. However It is very easy to just stop the running program and switch to a different program to enter a new or different time, pressure, or temp. It takes maybe ten seconds to do this. The only thing keeping you from thinking outside the box is you. Go crazy! Be creative! No Rules! For most, this probably would never even be an issue. I'm kinda finicky, (just ask my wife). For someone who just wants to have a pot of beef stew ready when they get home, no sweat, Read the manual, you won't encounter any problems, the standard settings will work fine). My initial rating was four stars because I thought I was limited by the presets. It turns out that is not really the case. With the InstantPot you really can do just about anything you want. It's just a matter or re-evaluating how you perceive you are able to use it. At first, the presets seem to be absolutes; they are not. It is all just a matter of perception, a little extra thought, a few more button clicks... or if you find the presets work well, as many reviewers have, you can literally just set it and forget it.

The even heating of the Tri-Clad bottom of the stainless steel liner is a best feature for me as it greatly reduces, if not in most instances, eliminates entirely any probability of scorching your food. The 3 preset settings seem to work as advertised for the most part. Suppose you are going to cook a thick sauce. The preset temp is often Med. which might be too high. When you first turn it on, with any of the four top LH settings you are able to increase or decrease temperature, time and pressure, Hi-Lo. For something thick, you may choose to change the temp from Med. to Low which should avoid scorching. What I do when slow-cooking, is select Saute and High temp setting to save time in order to get 3 1/2 quarts of soup mix boiling, then stop it, select Slow Cook and reset the time choosing a low and slow temperature to finish cooking. I find the best way to cook pasta is to fill it two-thirds full of water, Select Saute, high temp to get the water boiling furiously, stop and reset temp to Medium to finish cooking the pasta. It might prove quicker to cook pasta on your stove, but you can also do it with the InstantPot, drain the water, add spices, Italian Sausage and/or Meatballs, Marinara Sauce, Slow cook on low heat and keep warm with the glass lid on beside the dining room table for a leisurely, more pleasurable, (second helpings don't get cold), dining experience with friends and family. High temp is what you want when pressure cooking meat or poultry with 1 or 2 inches of water which decreases startup time. Cook for 45 minutes using one and a half inches of water because very little water escapes as steam! Just this minute, as I am writing this, (first review), I paused and went into the kitchen to check up on my 5 1/2 quarts of Cowboy Chile that I am slow-cooking. It was almost out of time. I decided it needed another hour, so I stopped it, shut it off, re-selected Slow Cook medium temp, and reset the time for one more hour. The program would have automatically stopped by itself, gone into Keep Warm mode, so you can re-start to cook it longer, anyhoo it's not a deal-breaker. When slow-cooking on Low, my Chile just gurgles away nicely without any scorching with the pot maxed out to within 1 inch from the top. (DO NOT even think about filling the pot past 2/3 full when pressure cooking!) Once, the pot (stainless steel liner) had been in the freezer half-full of frozen soup. I put the pot liner back in its place, put on the glass lid, turned it on to keep warm for a little over an hour. it fully de-frosted the soup which was nice and warm to boot! Don't know if any one would ever do that, but you can set the keep warm timer for up to 10 hours and forget about it, Swedish Meatballs served warm, Fondue? No danger of overheating or boiling away. I speed up the bean pre-soak by putting the beans in the pot and setting the keep warm for an hour, and then letting them sit overnight. I find this necessary in the High and dry climate of Northern Nevada. Everything I've cooked so far has turned out just the way I wanted it, but not without a little creative fiddling. Every new gadget requires a learning curve. Because of it's many features, practice makes perfect! I give the InstantPot designers credit as most automatic settings work well, automating it for ease of use and safety. Cooking is part Science, but, I think, more Art than Science. I have the glass lid on for attended operation. A more tactile experience in food preparation. When slow-cooking I can check on it from time to time and make little adjustments, e.g. more time, less heat, add more chicken stock, taste it, more Oregano, a little Paprika, It's done when it's done, however long that takes.

Most programs work just fine on full automatic, but some small exceptions may demand more online flexibility. I must admit that I am biased in that I very often combine pressure cooking with slow cooking. I live at 5,000 feet with 10% humidity in July. I store a lot of beans which dry out after 6 months. To slow-cook those beans from scratch takes hours and they still are not done because water boils here at 201 degrees. It is surprising what a difference that makes. In New Orleans beans have much higher moisture content and at 212 degrees are done in an hour or less. I have to use a rapid boil just to make tea. A pressure cooker is the great equalizer, a must at higher altitudes because 15 lbs is 15 lbs pressure inside the pot regardless of altitude. I take a little extra time with my beans by using the low pressure setting. I especially like the delay start, cook, auto shut-off, keep warm features. The cooking timer and auto shut-off is absolutely essential for peace of mind for unattended operation as I have been known to doze off when cooking late at night. Every electric cooking appliance I own, including my Induction Range, is flameless and has a timed shutoff feature. I am retired and have the time, but, for those busy people on the go, the set-it-and-forget-it, ability of the InstantPot may prove it's best feature.

I very much like my InstantPot and have used it 2 or 3 times a week for one-pot meals. Having used it now for almost half a year, (I've got a pot of Navy beans cooking now as I update this review). I would say my initial impression was pretty close. One thing I especially like is I use less pots and pans when I am using the InstantPot, (I dislike washing pots and pans). It has some great features which leads me to believe they are really trying to hit it out of the park with this one. A Canadian Distributor; ""Way to go eh! Makes me want to stand up and sing ""Oh Canada!""

I guess price/point is the big bugaboo with manufacturers. If they added 15 psi I would fork over a little extra cash to get the ""totally perfect"" all-in-one cooker. They could test market it as their top-of-the-line world-beater Ultra Deluxe 7.6 litre model. I believe people will pay a little more if they know what they are paying for. For those desiring the convenience of an all-in-one cooker, at the price, there is little competition. I think it's a great value. Bottom line is: ""I like it just fine the way it is."" The InstantPot has earned a permanent place in my kitchen.

Summer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life-Changing Kitchen Appliance,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2025","I can’t believe I waited this long to get an Instant Pot! This 7-in-1 pressure cooker has completely transformed the way I cook. It’s incredibly versatile — I’ve used it to make everything from tender stews and perfectly cooked rice to homemade yogurt and even cheesecake. The sauté function is a game changer for building flavor before pressure cooking, and the stainless steel inner pot is super easy to clean.

The included app with hundreds of recipes is also a huge bonus — it makes meal planning so much easier. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced cook, this Instant Pot takes the stress out of dinner prep. Highly recommend!"
Janine - Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought to make probiotic yogurt,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2025",I bought this to mainly make the probiotic yogurt I make for helping the microbiome. Tried a couple of other things but this machine is the simplest and most reliable thing I have found yet. And the yogurt is fantastic! Perfect! Set and forget and lets you set a long length of time which others sometimes cap off at 8-12 hrs. Keeps the constant temperature needed for reliable fermentation. I will probably use it for some meals as well but as of today this was an extremely good buy for me.
B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing Pot, my favorite appliance ever.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2014","I received my Instant Pot right before the end of the year as I had pre-ordered it. I had done a good amount of research on the previous model and was convinced it could replace my small slow cooker as well as diversify my cooking and reduce my time in the kitchen. The main improvements I liked on this model over the previous model was the holder for the lid on both sides of the handles of the pot, the larger display, and the main improvement I was interested in was the dual pressure setting (mainly comes in handy for veggies for me).

At first use it took a little getting used to this new appliance. Some of the features which take some getting used to for me were the pressure release valve, and how to use the electronic controls. When cooking in a pressure cooker using traditional methods it is necessary to set the pressure release valve to closed, this allows pressure to build up in the pot during cooking. During the first few times I had forgotten to twist the pressure release valve to closed. Not doing this will eventually cause a light whistling sound and steam to come out of the release. Twist it back and all is well. I mention this because I read a review giving this pot a 1 star rating, and I could tell they hadn't closed their pressure valve based on the results they said they achieved.

Once you have used it a few times you will remember to shut the valve, as I have. Once the valve is closed then the second part I found took some getting used to was the controls, but now I realize they couldn't be easier. This is truly set it and forget style here people. Once you close the valve on the lid and lock the lid in place (you will hear an electronic ""chime"" letting you know the lid is closed) then it's as easy as hitting the button labeled ""manual"" and choosing an amount of time with the selector. This will allow you to follow recipes for times if you'd like. You can also hit the ""pressure"" button to adjust between high and low pressure. There are also a whole bunch of pre programmed recipes, a slow cooker option and a convenient ""sauté"" function which I have used a number of times. 10 seconds after choosing your options the cooker will beep 3 times and the pot will start to heat up. (make sure again you have the pressure release valve closed here)

It takes varying amounts of time for the pot to heat up but usually it's between 5 and 10 minutes for the pot to create enough pressure to where it pushes up a metal lock on the back of the unit, this prevents you from opening the pot until the pot is at a safe pressure. Once the lock sets it's only a few minutes till the timer will count down on the pot letting you know how much time is left. So keep in mind it takes 20 minutes or so from start to finish to cook 10 minutes cook time on the pressure cooker. Sometimes it seems like nothing is happening, but if you listen carefully you will hear boiling in the pot whenever it is in cycle. Once the time is up the pot will stay locked until you release the pressure by twisting the pressure release valve, or by waiting for 10 minutes to an hour for the pressure to release naturally. This will drop the metal lock in the back so you can open up the pot. One feature i love is the keep warm function. After any cooking is completed the system automatically goes to ""keep warm."" One night i forgot my chili in the pot after cooking it, but woke up late at night on the couch to realize it was kept warm all night! Pressing the off button will toggle the keep warm function on and off.

The stainless steel cooking pot is very easy to clean, however 6 of 10 on the unit for ease of clean. I love the stainless steel insert especially, it is very thick and of high quality. I just ordered a second one so i can more easily cook and store a variety of different things without having to constantly be cleaning and moving containers and food.
It does take a bit of getting used to this seemingly complex cooker, but after a little reading of the manual (which is great by the way) and some experience you will be able to cook just about anything in the instant pot. I just started cooking in the last year and I'm cooking up some amazing soups, chilies, meats, rices, pastas, and vegetables all in my first couple weeks, and i'm a beginner!
After looking into the pressure settings (it runs at around 11.x PSI on high) I am able to better plan my cook times. Note: Many recipes I found for pressure cooking on high are for 15 PSI so I have had to add a few minutes to most recipes. I also live in Denver, CO so I have to add some cook time due to the higher altitude as well. I found some good info using google on how to adjust pressure cooking for altitude.

I would highly recommend picking up a food slicer with the instant pot as well. I am dicing onions, celery, carrots, pineapple, potatoes, and more in seconds instead of minutes, then with the help of the instant pot I've got that stuff cooked quick and served hot. The slicer in combination with the instant pot cuts my cook and prep time by a third to a half I would estimate, in some cases more. I got a top rated Borner slicer off Amazon for about $30, and it's worth every penny.
Most importantly the food tastes amazing, meats are tender, rice is well cooked, veggies are incredible. I would recommend this Pressure cooker to anyone in the market for a replacement slow cooker, someone looking to cook more quickly, anyone looking to eat healthier, and for any person without access to a stove.

I plan on purchasing more as gifts for family in the future. For those of you ordering an Instant Pot: Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner!"
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,It does cook very quick,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2025","Going from a slow cooker to an insta pot, it was a little confusing at first even with directions, but once you get past the first meal which turned out great. The meal was done in about an hour compared to eight hours and the meat was tender. Just make sure you have everything cut up and ready ahead of time because it is quick, especially if your going to saute your ingredients first."
oceans13,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just bought a new one after 9 years of Instant Pot bliss,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2025","This is absolutely the best countertop kitchen appliance ever made, and I've owned every type, including commercial grade appliances that cost hundreds of dollars. I love to cook, but I don't enjoy standing over a hot stove waiting for things to cook, so I have used all kinds of appliances to avoid the stovetop. In 2016, my 20-year old rice cooker went up in a literal puff of smoke, and I found the iPot on Amazon while shopping for a replacement. Since then, I rarely use the stove or other appliances at all. This changed my life, LOL. My culinary life has a before iPot and after iPot timeline. I've spent years adjusting all kinds of vegan recipes for electric pressure cooking and have made everything imaginable in the iPot - pasta, meatloaf, yogurt, cakes, potatoes, all kinds of grains, legumes, and beans, and an endless variety of curries, soups, etc. This does an incredible job of steaming vegetables at 0 minutes on the steam function with an immediate pressure release. My entire family has since joined the iPot revolution. The 6-quart size works great for a couple. This is a heavy duty, well built appliance. We bought an appliance sliding tray on Amazon to make it easier to move it from under the cabinet to the center of the countertop without having to lift it. I'd recommend replacing the seal with name brand replacement silicone rings when needed, as the third party rings didn't work as well for me. Amazon has several good vegan Instant Pot cookbooks if you don't want to experiment. After 9 years of faithful service about 5 times weekly, my iPot is having issues coming up to pressure when cooking small quantities, so I happily bought another one of the same model. The photo shows my old one preparing for retirement since the new one just arrived. I cannot give this product a high enough recommendation; stop reading reviews and start your own Instant Pot love affair!"

Mr. Sunny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the 3 qt capcity!!! Super powerful!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2025","I recently purchased the Instant Pot 3 Qt 7-in-1 Pressure Cooker, and it has quickly become an essential part of our family's cooking routine. This compact yet versatile appliance is perfect for smaller quantities especially for rice, lentils etc. It can cook upto 5 cups of rice, lentils and about 6 eggs. Additionally, it can also cook pasta perfectly using the manual pressure cook mode with high pressure setting & 5 mins.

Pros:

Versatility: The 7-in-1 functionality is impressive. It serves as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, sauté pan, yogurt maker, and warmer. This versatility means I can prepare a wide range of dishes with just one appliance. I love the schedule feature as it allows me to schedule the cooker ahead of time to a certain time so that I can come home to a hot cooked meal; once the cooking is done, it goes to the warm mode automatically.
Compact Size: The 3-quart size is ideal for small families or for smaller quantities. It doesn't take up much counter space, which is a big plus in my kitchen.
Ease of Use: The control panel is user-friendly with clear buttons and settings. Beginners may have a bit of a learning curve but there are a ton of youtube videos and online instructions for help.
Quick Cooking: The pressure cooking feature significantly reduces cooking time especially for rice, potatoes, eggs, lentils etc. I also noticed that it is lot more powerful compared to my other 6 Qt Instant Pot although that's an older model from 2016. I also like the Saute mode to saute a bunch of things before pressure cooking them especially meats.
Consistent Results: Every meal I've cooked so far has turned out perfectly. The Instant Pot maintains consistent pressure and temperature, ensuring even cooking. I also found it to be lot more energy efficient.
Cons:

Learning Curve: There is a bit of a learning curve if you're new to pressure cooking. However, the included manual and online resources are very helpful.
Limited Capacity: While the 3-quart size is perfect for small portions, it might not be sufficient for larger families or batch cooking.
Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase. The Instant Pot 3 Qt 7-in-1 Pressure Cooker has made meal prep easier and more enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile and efficient kitchen appliance."
Gulf coast living,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect size for 2 or 3 people and so easy to setup and put away,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2025","Love it! I have a HUGE Crockpot pressure cooker but because of the size its a lot of work to use and makes no sense for small meals. I thought I'd try a 3qt small pressure cooker and this led me to this item. After receiving it I was so happy to see that it was PERFECT size for 2 people. Within a few days I did short ribs for my wife and I. It accommodated 4 pieces of beef short ribs, carrots, celery and broth and cooked under pressure for 50 minutes. It came out PERFECT! I then removed the short ribs and finished reducing the sauce with the saute setting. It was so easy to clean and put away, and the portion size was more than enough for 2 people. Highly recommen."
Laurice,5.0 out of 5 stars,Versatile!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2025","I love this multi-cooker so much! After using the 8 quart cooker for a few years, which I love, I decided to get the 3 quart for my grains and beans. Most rice cookers have a non-stick coating, which I didn’t want. This is non-toxic stainless steel and does a LOT more than just cook perfect rice! I use it several times a week and I fully expect to use it for years to come. Rice and other grains, as well as beans are regulars on our menu, but I also use this work-horse for perfect “baked” potatoes and hard “boiled” eggs. The smaller size is so convenient and clean up is a breeze. Extra points for keeping the house cool during hot summer months!"
xocotl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Over all 100 Stars 🌟 But lid can't be resting on the side of the pot,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2025","Works so wonderfully like the first ones that came out. Heavy lid though and you need a bit more space to keep this.
No issues and highly satisfying. But the lid cannot be resting on the side of the pot,that's the only thing lacking.
Everything else is excellent!!!"

Anne P. Mitchell,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE My Instant Pot! But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2016","I LOVE my Instant Pot! But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well, yeah. So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!) Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for. Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle? Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to? Things like that.

So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life: incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes.

First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out). The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise. The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that). The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up. Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out.

The sauté function has three temperature settings: 'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit)

For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively). So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons).

The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure). That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low). However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button). Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want.

After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"". Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown. This is *normal*. The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure.

The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total. So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point). And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release.

All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms: natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR). What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release). The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure. A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)). On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time.

Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes.

Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!! Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance).

Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking. For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start.

Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note: the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post).

Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot.

Oh, actually there's one more thing. I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*! Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*. For up to 10 hours! You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you! Booyah! (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand. You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.)

Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot.

You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes). Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket.

Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set . The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile.

Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try your hand. Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot. There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time).

For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches). Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass.

If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them.

You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people. This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there. Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot. Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it.

In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books. Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception:

Pressure Cooker Perfection

I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!):

Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes

And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one:

O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free

..and this one:

Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker

And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes.

Poached Eggs: Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil. Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt). Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes. 2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude.

Baked Potatoes: Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes? And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~) Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours! Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer. Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure. Then walk away! Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.! This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes!

Happy Instant Potting!"

Dixie,5.0 out of 5 stars,SWEET LITTLE POT!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2025","Sweet little pot! It doesnt have an on/off switch but I can deal with that. I bought it mainly to cook rice and pasta in. When it was on sale, It cost the same as a dedicated high end rice cooker but this little pot does a lot more than just a rice cooker. I used the preset for the rice and my basmati rice turned out incredible. Just the way my hubby likes it which is separated & not gooey. I also own a 6qt Instant Pot & an 8 qt Ninja OL 701 EX Ninja Foodi 14 in 1. I love all my small kitchen appliances, theyve made me a better cook, but the larger Pressure cookers would burn my rice sometimes. So this 3qt was on sale during Prime day for cheap & Im very happy I bought it. No more burned rice! Of course I highly recommend this little pot. To make a real meal in it, I think would be enuff for one person or two if they are light eaters."
SUDHIR KAPOOR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect size for everyday use,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2025","At first, the lid on my initial unit wouldn’t close properly, so I returned it. The replacement arrived quickly and has been perfect! I’ve owned the 6-qt and 9-qt before—very useful but too big for everyday use. This 3-qt size is just right for our family of 4, and I’ve been using it almost daily. Last week I had my sisters along with her family visit-4 people, I was easily able to cook my black beans for 8 people in it. Delay start and auto turning to sealing is very helpful and a good enhancement. Super happy with this purchase."
Chris C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A life-changing experience!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2016","EDITED 06/07/2016: Sadly, I had to ask the manufacturer for a replacement unit, but I am still happy with the product, and am pleased with the manufacturer's customer service response.

Within two months of using my Instant Pot, I had grown completely dependent upon it for life support. Going back to cooking things on the stove seemed just as preposterous as starting a fire in the middle of my living room and roasting some meat on a spit. Then, tragedy struck. My IP would not come to pressure! Steam leaked constantly from the steam vent, and the countdown would not start. The display just read ""on"" indefinitely. The food would still cook, but the whole process was noisy and smelly. Also, food at the bottom of the pot would burn due the the lack of a tight seal. I carefully checked the steam vent and all the other components, and could find nothing wrong with any of them. I cooked this way six or seven times, putting up with the noisy steam venting, just to see if I could get it to work. Then, the next time I plugged in the IP, all the lights flashed, there were terrible beeping noises, and the display flashed, ""C6."" I immediately consulted the manual, the website and the Internets, and determined that this seems to be a common problem among IP owners, and that I would need to contact support.

There are two methods for contacting support, e-mail and their website. I think you may be able to call them on the phone but this is less effective. I created a ticket on the website and waited nervously. They responded in three business days. They asked me to provide the original receipt, a photo of the sticker on the back of the machine, a photo of the C6 error and my mailing address. I provided them the documentation a couple of days later. They quickly responded, and did not ask me any questions or force me to go through any sort of troubleshooting routine. They simply said they would rush mail me a new base right away. I asked about the problem with the steam vent, which preceded the C6 error, and another rep answered within a few minutes that they would also include a new lid in the same box. They also did not say that I had to mail back the first unit.

Within a few days I received a box via Fed Ex. I live in Hawaii, so shipping anything large via Fed Ex is very expensive for the company. The thick, sturdy outer cardboard box contained an inner box with the IP marketing printed on it. The inner box had tight styrofoam packaging. When Amazon originally mailed me the IP, they did NOT include an outer box but simply sent the thinner inner box through the mail with the shipping label right on it. This new mailing gave me some initial confidence that maybe this unit was not knocked around in transit as much as the first one. Also, the power cord was different. The first unit did not have a removable power cord, whereas this one's plugged into the back of the unit. They also included all the accessories - the sealing ring, rice paddle, drip catcher, steam rack, etc. The only thing that was missing from a brand-new purchase was the stainless steel inner pot. The old one still works fine, however.

So far, I have only had a chance to test it with water, but the new unit seems to work peachy.

I was initially going to change this to a 4-star review, since it is not acceptable for a product to break after only two months of use. I have two rice cookers, both Tiger brand made in Japan, and the first one has lasted nearly TWENTY YEARS and is still going strong! However, I give IP the benefit of the doubt that the first unit could have been somehow damaged in transit, although it worked fine initially. Also, it was a ""Warehouse Deal"" from Amazon so who knows what happened to it before it embarked upon its journey into my kitchen.

I look forward to getting my (new and improved) life back!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Is there an option for TEN stars?! I am thrilled with the Instant Pot - it has changed my life and I have not even gotten started yet.

I saw another electric pressure cooker advertised on TV, and it seemed like a miracle based on their glossy video. So I did some research and decided, based on the reviews and features, that I would rather have the Instant Pot than the other brand. However, because I have a very small kitchen that is already crowded with my Vitamix, I was reluctant to add another very large countertop appliance to the mix.

In the next few months, I was motivated by two cooking disasters involving my oven. Both times, I wanted to make a special Sunday dinner for my guests. The first time I tried to make baby back ribs in the oven. Hours later the ribs were nowhere near cooked, and with great shame I had to pull salmon out of the freezer and try to cook that from frozen instead. Humiliating and exhausting! After I cooked the ribs for hours more, they were way too soft and didn't taste right at all.

Next disaster - a whole chicken. Same story. My guests were waiting while I desperately tried to get the darn bird up to temperature. No luck! Finally I cut the chicken into pieces and shoved it back in the oven. I was able to finally serve it, but everybody practically gave up by then.

I immediately took the plunge and ordered one from Warehouse Deals. It seemed like a decent price and with Prime, items are returnable to Amazon. So I took the risk. The item arrived in its own cardboard box with no outer brown box, and the box was slightly damaged. There was no privacy & everyone in the office knew what I ordered. But no big deal. The problem was - I was a little intimidated about using it at first! In fact, it sat unopened for over a week. However, after I completely read the manual and included cookbook, I found that the operation of the machine was dead easy. The machine and accessories looked like new even though they were marked ""used"" on Warehouse deals.

So far, I have cooked with varying degrees of success: Corned beef brisket (perfect!), white rice (overcooked twice), black-eyed peas (overcooked in 8 minutes, 10 on warm), boneless chicken thighs (okay), boneless pork ribs (okay), custard cooked directly in Mason jars (overcooked twice), and Thai sticky rice (twice with excellent results).

The Thai sticky rice was the far and away winner. If you have ever tried to recreate this restaurant staple at home, you know it can be a tricky process. With the Instant Pot, it is so easy you may not even realize you've done any work! However, you do have to plan ahead. Here's how I did it: Purchase Thai sticky rice (I bought it at the local health food store). This is a special variety, so don't try to substitute another type of rice. Soak for 12 hours. Drain and rinse, and place rice inside of any glass bowl that will fit into the Instant Pot. Mold the wet rice around the sides of the bowl so that it is evenly distributed with a hollow in the middle. Place a steam rack over one inch of water in the inner pot. Place the glass bowl on top. Press Manual (high pressure) and set for 12 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. Reheat any leftovers by re-steaming inside the Instant Pot for Manual (high pressure) for 5 minutes. Reheating the rice in the microwave may not produce the same results.

Regarding the sealing ring - it definitely retains smells! I had some luck steaming vinegar in the pot but it did not take out all of the strong corned beef smell. I will try some other methods others have suggested. Meanwhile I tried to order an extra ring from Amazon for desserts. The ""Prime"" option was out of stock so I ordered one from Instant Pot as a third-party seller. When I tried to check out, I realized that Instant Pot was going to charge me $60 to ship the ring alone to Hawaii!!!!! No way!!! I found the ring on Walmart.com, and while I was unable to pick it up in the local store, I was able to get free shipping by adding some other needed items to the order. The new ring has not yet arrived.

I have planned out dozens of meals that I can't wait to try in the Instant Pot! Baby-back ribs of course, sweet-sour spareribs, saag paneer, all kinds of curry, etc. Not only was this purchase so worth it, I am kicking myself for not doing this years ago!"
