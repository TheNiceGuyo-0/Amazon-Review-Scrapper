Gulf coast living,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect size for 2 or 3 people and so easy to setup and put away,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2025","Love it! I have a HUGE Crockpot pressure cooker but because of the size its a lot of work to use and makes no sense for small meals. I thought I'd try a 3qt small pressure cooker and this led me to this item. After receiving it I was so happy to see that it was PERFECT size for 2 people. Within a few days I did short ribs for my wife and I. It accommodated 4 pieces of beef short ribs, carrots, celery and broth and cooked under pressure for 50 minutes. It came out PERFECT! I then removed the short ribs and finished reducing the sauce with the saute setting. It was so easy to clean and put away, and the portion size was more than enough for 2 people. Highly recommen."
Janine - Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought to make probiotic yogurt,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2025",I bought this to mainly make the probiotic yogurt I make for helping the microbiome. Tried a couple of other things but this machine is the simplest and most reliable thing I have found yet. And the yogurt is fantastic! Perfect! Set and forget and lets you set a long length of time which others sometimes cap off at 8-12 hrs. Keeps the constant temperature needed for reliable fermentation. I will probably use it for some meals as well but as of today this was an extremely good buy for me.

Dawn R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this pressure cooker.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2025","Love this pot. So far I have only pressure cooked. It cleans up easily. The lid can go into the dishwasher, but I hand wash it. It was hard to remove the seal ring the first time, but after that fairly easy because I knew what to do. Can't wait until artichokes are in season. It will be nice to cook them over a shorter time. My first meal was a Cornish game hen. The meat was moist and tender and falling off the bone. Very yummy. I bought the smallest size, perfect for a single person but can also feed a family."

Mel,4.0 out of 5 stars,3 Qt is a good size for 1 or 2 people,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2019","I'm new to pressure cooking, and it makes me a little nervous! But I read a lot of good things about the instant pot so I decided to take the plunge and buy one.

I originally bought the 6 qt size and it was too heavy for me to lift in and out of a cabinet frequently. It might have been ok if it was going to stay on a counter and always be out. This smaller size is easier to move around, and since I'm not feeding a family, it's fine for me. I might get the bigger one if I had the counter space so I could make larger batches of food at once, but for now this one's fine.

So far it's worked well.

It doesn't always save time.

For starters, there's a sear function. I guess some people like the idea of searing and then cooking in the same pot. I think it's faster and easier to sear something in a pan on the stove and then put it in.

As a matter of fact, anything that can cook in an hour or less on the stove, will probably be easier and faster on the stove. Because keep in mind, the instant pot takes about 15 to 20 minutes to heat up, then there's the actual cooking time (usually 15 minutes to an hour for most recipes), then depending on what you're cooking, you can do a quick release of pressure, or let the instant pot cool down on its own.

When I tried to do a quick release (as one recipe told me to do!) it didn't just release steam, but a geyser of liquid and grease all over my kitchen! So now I let it cool down on its own - which takes another 20 to 30 minutes. So anything I make in the instant pot will take me at least an hour start to finish. Maybe more. And it's more pieces to clean up than one pot on the stove. However, something cooking in an instant pot doesn't have to be watched as carefully for that hour its in use. I can walk away and do other things that I might not be able to do while cooking on a stove for an hour.

But in general, for something that would normally take more than an hour on the stove or oven, this can work well. For me, if I can cook it on the stove or oven, start to finish, in an hour or so, I'll usually chose the stove or oven. The instant pot cook time might be 15 minutes, but with the warm up and cool down, it can take an hour there too.

Safety issues I have are with the steam release valve. The open and closed position are not clearly marked. They're marked, but in small raised black lettering on a black background that's hard to see. So what's the logical thing to do? Lean in to read it! But you do NOT want to lean in or have any part of your body near the steam valve! I wish that was marked in a way that was easier to see.

Another issue with the steam release valve is the same as it would be for any pressure cooker. If you're not used to pressure cooking, it's easy to grab it from the top which will result in major burns if you open it that way! This isn't a problem that's limited to instant pots, but it's a safety feature I wish someone would address with pressure cookers in general. Maybe invent a steam release valve that is not easy to grip from the top, or impossible to grip from the top. Something that can only be opened using a side lever.

I worry about older people or distracted people using these or any pressure cookers. If you have children around, make sure they can't get near this. - Much like any item that gets hot during cooking and can burn. There are safety features to keep the pot from being opened if the steam has not been released (quickly or naturally after it cools down on its own) but the quick release steam valve can be really dangerous if it's moved to the open position by a child, a distracted person, or a curious pet who might lean in for a sniff!

Another thing to know is that the silicone seal will absorb food odors - as all silicone does. I don't really mind much. I've read that some people buy extra silicone rings and use one for savory cooking and one for sweet so the odor doesn't affect their cooking flavors. I'm not sure that's needed, but extra silicone rings are inexpensive on amazon. (about $5 I think?)

Other than the things mentioned above, I'm happy with the instant pot! It works well, cooks well, you can set the pressure and time manually or use a pre-set setting, and it even has a slow cooker setting if I decide to go back to slow cooking instead of pressure cooking.

I don't use mine regularly like people who are nuts about these. I use mine once in a while. Maybe about 10 times so far. Overall, it works very well and I'm happy I bought it. I'm especially happy with this size. It's more manageable to lift and move around if you'll be keeping it in a cabinet and not out all the time.

Mauricio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pr√°ctica, bonita, funcional","Reviewed in Mexico on January 17, 2025","Es exactamente para 2 personas. La tengo desde hace a√±o y medio y la adoro
Informaci√≥n que cura: Le caben exactamente medio kilo de frijoles crudos ya remojados (obvio con el agua, cebolla, etc).
Me ha sido tremendamente √∫til ya que soy vegetariano y suelo comer muchas legumbres todos los d√≠as y este juguetito me ha resuelto la vida cuando estoy en un apuro. Ya he hecho frijoles, quinoa, arroz blanco e integral, huevos duros, lentejas, garbanzos (quedan perfectos), avena, cebada. Y creo que ya. Pero todo queda muy bien, solamente debes anotar los tiempos que lleva cada cosa.
EXCELENTE PRODUCTO."
Judy L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has the same functionality as the Instant Pot Pro, but allows cooking of larger food items.","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2025","I have this pressure cooker as well as the 8 quart Instant Pot Pro, and love them both. The Instant Pot Rio has all of the same functionality as the Instant pot pro, but the wider pot allows pressure cooking of larger roasts without having to cut them up. The cook time, build quality, and cooking speed is all the same as the Instant Pot Pro. The only difference is only the wider, lower cook pot. Although I use the Instant Pot Pro most often, I appreciate the wider pot for pressure cooking larger roasts.

I hope this review was helpful for you."
ShopperFromIL,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect size for a 2-3 people,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2025","Perfect size for 2 or 3 people and so easy to setup and put away.

The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the different food (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).

It significantly reduces cooking times, making it a lifesaver on busy weeknights. Whether I'm preparing tender stews, fall-off-the-bone ribs, or flavor-packed soups, the Instant Pot never fails to deliver perfectly cooked meals in a fraction of the time.

The included app with hundreds of recipes is also a huge bonus ‚Äî it makes meal planning so much easier. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an experienced cook, this Instant Pot takes the stress out of dinner prep. Highly recommend!"
